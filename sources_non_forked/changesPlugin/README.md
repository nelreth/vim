# Changes plugin
> A Vim plugin for displaying changes in a buffer

This plugin was written to help visualize which lines have been changed since
editing started for a file. The plugin was inspired by so called changed-bars,
available at other editors, such as Embarcadero C++ Builder (there it is
called [Change Bars](http://edn.embarcadero.com/article/33453#6PersonalDeveloperProductivity)
or Visual Studio where it is called [indicator margin](http://blog.eveningcreek.com/?p=151).

ChangesPlugin.vim uses the diff-feature of vim and compares the actual
buffer with it's saved state (or possibly against a state in a VCS repository).
In order to highlight the indicator signs at the first column, its using
signs.

See also the following screencast, that shows several features available:
![screencast of the plugin](screencast.gif "Screencast")

Note, that a '-' indicates, that at least one line was deleted between that
particular line and the following line.

Features:
* Shows signs for added, modified, and deleted lines.
* Quick jumping between changed blocks ("hunks").
* Tries to updated signs as fast as possible
* Optional line highlighting.
* Customisable
* Many different Commands (fold all non changed lines, show changed lines in Quickfix window, opens a diff split...)
* Preserves signs from other plugins.
* Built-in integration with [vim-airline](https://github.com/bling/vim-airline/).
* good documentation
* quick response
* Nice icons for gvim
* Uses Vim 8 async feature for parsing the diff

#### Why another git-gutter/vim-signify clone?
To be fair, there were a lot of other vim plugins, that offered the same functionality as those two. They just didn't get the same attention as those two. ChangesPlugin was one of those plugins.

### Installation
Use the plugin manager of your choice. For example with [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) use:
```
cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone https://github.com/chrisbra/changesPlugin.git
```

[Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle) users do add `Plugin 'chrisbra/changesPlugin'` to your `~/.vimrc` and then issue `:PluginInstall` from within Vim.

### Usage
Once installed, take a look at the help at `:h ChangesPlugin`

Here is a short overview of the functionality provided by the plugin:
#### Ex commands:
    :EC  - Active the plugin (displays indicators of changes for the current buffer
    :DC  - Disable the plugin
    :TCV - Toggles the plugin
    :CC  - Show a small help window
    :CL  - Opens the Quickfix window with all changes for the current buffer
    :CD  - Opens a diff view for the current buffer
    :CF  - Folds away all non-changed lines
    :CT  - Toggles how the highlighting is displayed
#### Mappings
    ]h   - Moves forward to the next changed line
    [h   - Moves backwards to the previous changed line
    ah   - Selects the current hunk (TextObject)
    <Leader>h - Stage the hunk, the cursor is on (works only for git)

### Configuration

`g:changes_autocmd` (default: 1) - update automatically the signs using InsertLeave and TextChanged autocommands.

`g:changes_vcs_check` (default: 0)

`g:changes_vcs_system` (default: '') - Check against a version in a repository (e.g. git/mercurial) and specify VCS to use (if not specified, will try to autodetect).

`g:changes_diff_preview` (default: 0) - Display diff in the preview window

`g:changes_respect_SignColumn` (default 0) - If not set, will reset the SignColumn highlighting to that of the Normal Highlighting group

`g:changes_sign_text_utf8` (default 1) - If set, will display nice little utf-8 signs.

`g:changes_linehi_diff` (default: 0) - If set, will overlay the text with a highlighting for the actual difference within the line.

`g:changes_use_icons` (default: 1) - If set, will display graphical icons if support is available.

#### Similar Work
[vim-gitgutter](https://github.com/airblade/vim-gitgutter)
Only works for git, only updates the signs on write

[vim-signify](https://github.com/mhinz/vim-signify/)
supports several VCS, only updates the sign on write
